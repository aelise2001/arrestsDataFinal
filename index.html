    With recent NYPD raids on student encampments students have been met with aggressive tactics and excessive force, with unfair charges by the NYPD. And depending on where those students are attending school they seem to be encountering a diverse set of accusations by the NYPD.

    Of the 173 arrests stemming from campus protests at City College of New York, more total felony charges were levied against those arrested at the CUNY school than against the 217 arrested in connection with protests at Columbia.

        The disparate charges, which are attributed to their respective precincts of occurrence, are consistent with CCRB data that show more allegations of excessive force in the precinct home to City College.

    Protesters at CCNY and CU were disproportionately arrested for more severe crimes. And that may be due to where they were arrested. Protestors arrested near City College, which sits squarely within the confines of the 30th precinct, were routinely issued felony summonses in larger numbers than their Columbia counterparts, which is housed in the 26th precinct.

<br>





    As far as the commanding officer at the precinct being in charge of decisions, “If they are aware of something going they’ll have a role in planning it but usually if it’s something larger scale they’ll have people from the borough involved,” said police sources familiar with protest response.

    “For large gatherings, they are brought to MAPC. Most of the time they are given summonses… and then there’s desk appearances tickets which are misdemeanors. It would only go on the stats if it was a felony assault. The stat number would go to the precinct… the majority of them for large demonstrations”, according to an NYPD spokesperson.

“Usually we have details, like a mix of cops from admin positions, from Brooklyn precincts. There’ll will be most likely officers out from the local precinct, but the majority of them are going to be from all over different units.” they went on saying,“SRG is usually what deals with protests. They’re the ones usually making the arrests. You see it on their armbands where they’re from. At Columbia, any patrol officer there had to wear helmets and batons. That’s just protocol because of flying objects.”

    The NYPD utilizes a citywide pool of officers to respond to large protests, including officers like Shahel Miah, who have been accused of excessive force.

    At the CUNY protest, one protestor alleged Miah broke their hand after striking it with a department issued baton, as first reported by The Campus Meeting at CCNY. 
    
    The 30th precinct, home to City College, serves the Hamilton Heights section of Harlem and is 10% white, 32% Black and 52% Hispanic.
    
    The 26th precinct, home to Columbia, is four times whiter than their neighboring precinct to the north.
    
    “Arrests are assigned to the precinct of occurrence i.e. Columbia arrests were in the 28 and CUNY arrests were in the 30,” according to the NYPD.

    Videos of aggressive policing began to circulate on social media and were later reported by THE CITY. 

    Farida Shaheed, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to education, says that heavy handed NYPD policing tactics and hefty charges levied are but one part of a multi pronged effort to suppress student activism.
    
    “The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed concern over the acts of violence, mass arrests and sanctions against members of the educational community who are mobilizing on issues of public interest in the United States. In this regard, it called on the US to respect and guarantee the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and academic freedom, and to provide opportunities for dialogue to address the concerns of the demonstrators,” said Shaheed in a statement.
    
    Given the elevated felony charges, protestors arrested in connection with City College protests could see hundreds of  years in prison.
    
    But due to the overwhelming majority of misdemeanor charges levied against Columbia protestors, they would see significantly less jail time. 
    
    The majority of protestors arrested had no priors, were released on their own recognizance and are expected to be given a slap on the wrist, according to court records.

Armed Conflict Location Engagement Data said, “Police intervention against conflict-related student demonstrations more than quadrupled in April. They arrested demonstrators and physically dispersed crowds much more frequently at demonstrations with counter-demonstrators. However, in cases where student demonstrators have gathered unopposed, police have intervened against pro-Palestine demonstrations more than four times as often as pro-Israel demonstrations”



    With recent NYPD raids on student encampments students have been met with aggressive tactics and excessive force, with unfair charges by the NYPD. And depending on where those students are attending school they seem to be encountering a diverse set of accusations by the NYPD.

    Reported by The Campus Magazine at CCNY on social media, a protester was hit by a police baton, causing injuries to the hand and excessive bleeding. The officer accused of, Shahel Miah, was identified by their badge number #26604, . They later posted an update on the student protestor’s condition as having a broken hand and a fully fractured finger bone

    Shahel Miah has a track record of complaints with the CCRB over the years. Specifically four complaints were filed by four different Black men accusing Miah of abuse of authority to use excessive force.
