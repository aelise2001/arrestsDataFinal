<h1>

</h1>

<em> 
<h3>
    In city precincts with more complaints filed by civilians, protestors were treated with more force and charged with more severe crimes.

    With recent NYPD raids on student encampments students have been met with aggressive tactics and excessive force, with unfair charges by the NYPD. And depending on where those students are attending school they seem to be encountering a diverse set of accusations by the NYPD.

    Of the 173 arrests stemming from campus protests at City College of New York, more total felony charges were levied against those arrested at the CUNY school than against the 217 arrested in connection with protests at Columbia.

        The disparate charges, which are attributed to their respective precincts of occurrence, are consistent with CCRB data that show more allegations of excessive force in the precinct home to City College.

<p> 

    Protesters at CCNY and CU were disproportionately arrested for more severe crimes. And that may be due to where they were arrested. Protestors arrested near City College, which sits squarely within the confines of the 30th precinct, were routinely issued felony summonses in larger numbers than their Columbia counterparts, which is housed in the 26th precinct.

    Both precincts, the 26 and the 30, have numerous officers with allegations of excessive force.

    Videos of aggressive policing began to circulate on social media and were later reported by Tk outlet. But Farida Shaheed, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to education, says that the heavy handed NYPD policing tactics and hefty charges levied are but one part of a multi pronged effort to suppress student activism.

    “The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed concern over the acts of violence, mass arrests and sanctions against members of the educational community who are mobilizing on issues of public interest in the United States. In this regard, it called on the US to respect and guarantee the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and academic freedom, and to provide opportunities for dialogue to address the concerns of the demonstrators,” said Shaheed in a statement.

    Given the elevated felony charges, protestors arrested in connection with City College protests could see more than 700 years in prison. But due to an overwhelming majority of misdemeanor charges levied against Columbia protestors, students, staff and non-affiliated protestors would only see 100 years in prison.

    The vast majority of protestors arrested were released with a slap on the wrist, while TK still has charges pending according to court records.
